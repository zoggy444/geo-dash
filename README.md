# Geo-dash

This is based on an exercise I gave myself in my personal playground. I decided to make it a fully-fledge project !

## BDD

It is developed following the Behavior-Driven Development approach. Allowing a good regression test suite and living documentation.

This project leverages playwrite-bdd instead of cucumber.

Feature files and step definition can be found in `/features`.

## Functional content

In this first version, the user can play at locating french regions and departments on the map.

Next I will add some styling to it.

And after that, I will add another page that will focus on data visualisation. The idea will be to have an interactive map connected to a list view.
